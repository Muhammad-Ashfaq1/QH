                                    <p>Innovation is our heritage.</p>
                                    <p>Originally established in 1896, the company is a brainchild of the 2nd industrial
                                        revolution that gave rise
                                        to the electrification of the world. From its earliest beginnings through GE’s
                                        acquisition of the brand in

                                        challenges of the
